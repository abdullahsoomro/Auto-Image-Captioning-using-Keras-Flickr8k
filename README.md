# Auto Image Captioning using Keras on Flickr8k dataset 
>Image Caption Generator or Photo Descriptions is one of the Applications of Deep Learning. In Which we have to pass the image to the model and the model does some processing and generating captions or descriptions as per its training. 
>I have used the Flickr 8k dataset which you can download by filling this form (https://forms.illinois.edu/sec/1713398) provided by the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
>This dataset contains 8000 images each with 5 captions (as we have already seen in the Introduction section that an image can have multiple captions, all being relevant simultaneously).
